# Behevioral_Tree_AI

Behevioral Tree AI made for Unity Engine, but after some changes can be used in Other Game Engines.

Used in my indie game Sails Of Glory.

Project is with functioning Blackboard, basic composite and decorator nodes, and example action (leafs) nodes that I used in my projects.

In future I would Like to implement optimised tree traversal.
